# textexcel

AP Computer Science A final project.  
Basic spreadsheet program written in Java.  
  
Made this in about a week.  
Not the best code quality, but meets the spec (excluding non-AVG/SUM formulas)  
  
To run this, you'll need `javac` installed and on your PATH.  
Quick and dirty one-liner (run from project root):  
`javac -d bin src/textExcel/*.java; cd bin; java -cp . textExcel.TextExcel; cd ..`
